	 - Introduction of hooks.
	 - Set up framework for support of styling properties. Only
	   very few are supported, though.
	 - Examples directory. Only one very simple example so far.
	 - Tested on Perl 5.8.9 with only the documented dependency
	   modules.

	 Changed namespace from SVG::Render to SVG::Rasterize. It's
	 much more specific.

	 - Reorganization of the viewport initialization. The root
	   svg element is much less special now.
	 - State only uses the name and attributes of a node. The
	   only exception is the provision of the nextChild
	   method. The node object is still saved for the use in
	   hooks, but it is not used. The distinction between
	   parsing a DOM tree or a file is entirely made in
	   SVG::Render.
	 - Revised the concept of length to number mapping preparing
	   it for the support of relative lengths.
