Revision history for SVG-Rasterize

0.003007 Tue May  3 19:51:07 NZST 2011
	 - Incompatible changes:
	   - The default backend SVG::Rasterize::Cairo has been
	     renamed to SVG::Rasterize::Engine::PangoCairo. There is
	     a base class SVG::Rasterize::Engine which backends
	     should inherit from. If you are selecting the
	     rasterization backend explicitly you will have to
	     update your code. Otherwise - unless you are
	     maintaining your own rasterization backend for
	     SVG::Rasterize - this change is completely transparent
	     for you.
	 - more font attributes
	 - minor fixes and improvements
	 - docu expansion

0.003006 Thu Apr 28 20:21:15 NZST 2011
	 - Incompatible changes:
	   - The current_text_position method of
	     SVG::Rasterize::State has gone.
	 - Fixes bug #67699.
	 - Major revision of the traversal of the node tree enabling
	   a much cleaner approach to deferred rasterization of text
	   elements. This should be transparent even for hooks.
	 - Major revision of the way text is processed. This
	   framework will hopefully be fully capable of handling
	   text correctly including bidi text etc..
	 - Alignment of text via text-anchor
	 - Positioning of individual characters

0.003005 Fri Apr 22 11:53:35 NZST 2011
	 - Support for more text attributes:
	   - font-size (except relative font sizes)
	 - Regex check of ID attributes.
	 - Reorganized docu to increase user friendliness.
	 - Reorganization and substantial expansion of test suite,
	   guided by Devel::Cover.
	 - Comments are ignored now as they should. This fixes bug
	   RT#62943. Additionally, title, desc, and metadata
	   elements are ignored.
	 - Minor bug fixes.

0.003004 Thu Jun 17 13:16:14 NZST 2010
	 - Adds support for currentColor and hex color settings.
	 - Introduces methods to restore default hooks.
	 - Makefile.PL tests for sufficiently high versions of the
	   cairo and pango C libraries thereby avoiding failing
	   CPAN testers smoke tests.

0.003003 Sun Jun 13 20:48:11 NZST 2010
	 This is a maintenance release covering the following
	 improvements:
	 - The specification is split into different modules
	   (according to the classes in the DTD) which are only
	   loaded when needed. The avoids loading the 12KB
	   Specification module at the start even if only small bits
	   will be used.
	 - The specification modules now contain information which
	   elements are allowed to hold parsed character data (other
	   than white space). This is checked during validation.
	 - Class::Accessor now also throws an Exception::Class
	   object if it is attempted to set a readonly attribute.

0.003002 Fri Jun 11 20:09:34 NZST 2010
	 - Now introducing the Pango dependency (see 0.003001).
	 - Starting support for text elements. This brings some
	   little, but not backwards compatible changes in the
	   interface of SVG::Rasterize::State:
	   - The child nodes are determined outside of state now and
             handed over to the constructor.
	   - The method hasChildNodes has gone, and nextChild has
             been renamed to shift_child_node.
	 - Additionally, there has been an interface change of the
           before_node_hook (which was marked as experimental). It
	   now receives named parameters and is expected to return a
	   (potentially modified) hash.
	 - Various bug fixes including RT#58114.
	 - Detailed audit of the main docu.

0.003001 Thu Jun  3 20:36:38 NZST 2010
	 - Main purpose for this (kind of premature) release: Fixes
	   bug in SVG::Rasterize::Cairo that prohibit the
	   specification of an output file name.
	 - New dependency Pango (1.220 or higher)...postponed in
	   order to allow testing my perl 5.8.9 installation.
	 - Fixes bug in validation of attributes with a list of
	   valid values.

0.003000 Wed Jun  2 20:41:08 NZST 2010
	 Identical to 0.002003.

0.002003 Wed Jun  2 20:34:37 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Prepared the framework for greater flexibility in output
           formats etc..
	 - Docu fixes and expansion.

0.002002 Tue Jun  1 21:08:09 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Partial rendering of paths, polylines, and polygons if
	   they are in error.
	 - Consequent use of Params::Validate (or documentation that
	   parameters are not validated).
	 - Documentation of diagnostics.
	 - Docu fixes and expansion.

0.002001 Sun May 30 16:21:15 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - New dependency Exception::Class (1.29 or higher).
	 - Proper error handling as required by spec (except partial
	   rendering of path, polyline, and polygon).
	 - Docu fixes.
	 - All methods return explicitly.

0.002000 Tue May 25 15:42:09 NZST 2010
	 Documentation updates.

0.001006 Tue May 25 15:06:16 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Adds support for all basic shapes
	   - rect
	   - circle
	   - ellipse
	   - (line was already supported)
	   - polyline
	   - polygon
	 - Revision of large parts of the docu.

0.001005 Sun May 23 21:39:39 NZST 2010
	 - Color filling (no gradients, patterns etc.).
	 - (Semi-)transparent stroking and filling including
	   different opacity values for stroke and fill and without
	   the fill shining through transparent stroke.
	 - Further newly supported properties (all fill and stroke
	   properties):
	   - fill-rule
	   - stroke-linecap
	   - stroke-linejoin
	   - stroke-miterlimit
	   - stroke-dashoffset
	   - stroke-dasharray
	 - Bugfixes:
	   - in processing of explicit 'inherit' property
	     values
	   - in path data processing
	   - color values are clamped at presentation time instead
	     of parsing time (as recommended by the spec).

0.001004 Fri May 21 21:19:54 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Elliptical arcs including example script.

0.001003 Thu May 20 19:59:30 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Support for all path commands except elliptical arc.
	 - Core documentation up-to-date.

0.001002 Sun May 16 19:33:22 NZST 2010
	 - The final transformation matrix is now applied by the
	   rasterization engine and not by SVG::Rasterize. This is
	   necessary for correct stroke-width handling with
	   inhomogeneous scaling and skewing.
	 - Introduces partial path support. All valid path data
	   strings are swallowed, but only moveto, closepath, and
	   lineto commands are supported, the rest is ignored.
	 - Reorganizes SVG::Rasterize::Regexes into a set of
	   hashes. The namespace pollution became uncontrollable.

0.001001 Thu May 13 20:59:13 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Further consolidates the usage of attribute checking and
	   processing using regexes in SVG::Rasterize::Regexes.
	 - Further completion of %SVG::Specification::ATTR_VAL.

0.001000 Wed May 12 21:00:58 NZST 2010
	 Identical to 0.000009.

0.000009 Wed May 12 20:55:57 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Introduces SVG::Rasterize::Specification,
	   SVG::Rasterize::Properties, and
	   SVG::Rasterize::Colors. These files are at least
	   semiautomatically created from the DTD or human readable
	   specification. This hopefully finalizes the general
	   structure of the framework to deal with attributes and
	   properties.
	 - Commonly uses regexes are outsourced in
	   SVG::Rasterize::Regexes leading to much cleaner code.
	 - Unsetting of hooks (to undef) now passes parameter
	   validation.

0.000008 Thu May  6 13:28:45 NZST 2010
	 - Corrects docu issues that I have only seen unce uploaded.
	 - Removes POD that slipped into README making the CPAN
	   version look empty.
	 - Homogenizes interface of new and rasterize. The rasterize
	   method now accepts temporary values for (the relevant)
	   object attributes.
	 - Input objects are now validated by interface, not by
	   class, allowing generic DOM objects (not necessarily SVG
	   subclasses) to be rendered.
	 - The rasterization backend is initialized as early as
	   possible allowing early in_error. Makes the root element
	   even less special.

0.000007 Mon May  3 14:41:06 NZST 2010
	 - normalization of attribute values according to XML
           specification
	 - revised docu

0.000006 Sun May  2 22:09:43 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Introduction of hooks.
	 - Set up framework for support of styling properties. Only
	   very few are supported, though.
	 - Examples directory. Only one very simple example so far.
	 - Tested on Perl 5.8.9 with only the documented dependency
	   modules.

0.000005 Fri Apr 30 13:15:59 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 Changed namespace from SVG::Render to SVG::Rasterize. It's
	 much more specific.

0.000004 Fri Apr 30 11:22:36 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Reorganization of the viewport initialization. The root
	   svg element is much less special now.
	 - State only uses the name and attributes of a node. The
	   only exception is the provision of the nextChild
	   method. The node object is still saved for the use in
	   hooks, but it is not used. The distinction between
	   parsing a DOM tree or a file is entirely made in
	   SVG::Render.
	 - Revised the concept of length to number mapping preparing
	   it for the support of relative lengths.

0.000003 Thu Apr 29 15:51:16 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - (Almost) full documentation of SVG::Render and
	   SVG::Render::State.

0.000002 Wed Apr 28 19:33:09 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Full support for the transform attribute.
	 - Support for absolute units.
	 - Initial viewport including viewBox and
           preserveAspectRatio.

0.000001 Sun Apr 25 19:43:28 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
         First release, proof of concept only. Can only draw black
         lines of fixed width. Shows successful deployment of Cairo.
