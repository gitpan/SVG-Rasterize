Revision history for SVG-Rasterize

0.000008 Thu May  6 13:28:45 NZST 2010
	 - Corrects docu issues that I have only seen unce uploaded.
	 - Removes POD that slipped into README making the CPAN
	   version look empty.
	 - Homogenizes interface of new and rasterize. The rasterize
	   method now accepts temporary values for (the relevant)
	   object attributes.
	 - Input objects are now validated by interface, not by
	   class, allowing generic DOM objects (not necessarily SVG
	   subclasses) to be rendered.
	 - The rasterization backend is initialized as early as
	   possible allowing early in_error. Makes the root element
	   even less special.

           specification

	 - Introduction of hooks.
	 - Set up framework for support of styling properties. Only
	   very few are supported, though.
	 - Examples directory. Only one very simple example so far.
	 - Tested on Perl 5.8.9 with only the documented dependency
	   modules.

	 Changed namespace from SVG::Render to SVG::Rasterize. It's
	 much more specific.

0.000004 Fri Apr 30 11:22:36 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Reorganization of the viewport initialization. The root
	   svg element is much less special now.
	 - State only uses the name and attributes of a node. The
	   only exception is the provision of the nextChild
	   method. The node object is still saved for the use in
	   hooks, but it is not used. The distinction between
	   parsing a DOM tree or a file is entirely made in
	   SVG::Render.
	 - Revised the concept of length to number mapping preparing
	   it for the support of relative lengths.
