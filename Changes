Revision history for SVG-Rasterize

0.001002 Sun May 16 19:33:22 NZST 2010
	 - The final transformation matrix is now applied by the
	   rasterization engine and not by SVG::Rasterize. This is
	   necessary for correct stroke-width handling with
	   inhomogeneous scaling and skewing.
	 - Introduces partial path support. All valid path data
	   strings are swallowed, but only moveto, closepath, and
	   lineto commands are supported, the rest is ignored.
	 - Reorganizes SVG::Rasterize::Regexes into a set of
	   hashes. The namespace pollution became uncontrollable.

0.001001 Thu May 13 20:59:13 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Further consolidates the usage of attribute checking and
	   processing using regexes in SVG::Rasterize::Regexes.
	 - Further completion of %SVG::Specification::ATTR_VAL.

0.001000 Wed May 12 21:00:58 NZST 2010
	 Identical to 0.000009.

0.000009 Wed May 12 20:55:57 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Introduces SVG::Rasterize::Specification,
	   SVG::Rasterize::Properties, and
	   SVG::Rasterize::Colors. These files are at least
	   semiautomatically created from the DTD or human readable
	   specification. This hopefully finalizes the general
	   structure of the framework to deal with attributes and
	   properties.
	 - Commonly uses regexes are outsourced in
	   SVG::Rasterize::Regexes leading to much cleaner code.
	 - Unsetting of hooks (to undef) now passes parameter
	   validation.

0.000008 Thu May  6 13:28:45 NZST 2010
	 - Corrects docu issues that I have only seen unce uploaded.
	 - Removes POD that slipped into README making the CPAN
	   version look empty.
	 - Homogenizes interface of new and rasterize. The rasterize
	   method now accepts temporary values for (the relevant)
	   object attributes.
	 - Input objects are now validated by interface, not by
	   class, allowing generic DOM objects (not necessarily SVG
	   subclasses) to be rendered.
	 - The rasterization backend is initialized as early as
	   possible allowing early in_error. Makes the root element
	   even less special.

0.000007 Mon May  3 14:41:06 NZST 2010
	 - normalization of attribute values according to XML
           specification
	 - revised docu

0.000006 Sun May  2 22:09:43 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Introduction of hooks.
	 - Set up framework for support of styling properties. Only
	   very few are supported, though.
	 - Examples directory. Only one very simple example so far.
	 - Tested on Perl 5.8.9 with only the documented dependency
	   modules.

0.000005 Fri Apr 30 13:15:59 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 Changed namespace from SVG::Render to SVG::Rasterize. It's
	 much more specific.

0.000004 Fri Apr 30 11:22:36 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Reorganization of the viewport initialization. The root
	   svg element is much less special now.
	 - State only uses the name and attributes of a node. The
	   only exception is the provision of the nextChild
	   method. The node object is still saved for the use in
	   hooks, but it is not used. The distinction between
	   parsing a DOM tree or a file is entirely made in
	   SVG::Render.
	 - Revised the concept of length to number mapping preparing
	   it for the support of relative lengths.

0.000003 Thu Apr 29 15:51:16 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - (Almost) full documentation of SVG::Render and
	   SVG::Render::State.

0.000002 Wed Apr 28 19:33:09 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
	 - Full support for the transform attribute.
	 - Support for absolute units.
	 - Initial viewport including viewBox and
           preserveAspectRatio.

0.000001 Sun Apr 25 19:43:28 NZST 2010 (unpublished)
         First release, proof of concept only. Can only draw black
         lines of fixed width. Shows successful deployment of Cairo.
