SVG-Rasterize

Rasterize SVG content to pixel graphics.

SVG::Rasterize can be used to rasterize SVG objects to pixel
graphics building on the perl bindings of the cairo library (by
default, other underlying rasterization engines could be added). The
direct rasterization of SVG _files_ might be implemented in the
future, right now you should have a look at SVG::Parser which can
generate an SVG object from an svg file.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

DEPENDENCIES

SVG::Rasterize depends on the following modules:

Class::Accessor,  version 0.30  or higher
SVG,              version 2.37  or higher
Cairo,            version 1.061 or higher
Pango,            version 1.220 or higher
Params::Validate, version 0.91  or higher
Scalar::Util,     version 1.19  or higher
Exception::Class, version 1.29  or higher
Test::More,       version 0.86  or higher
Test::Exception   version 0.27  or higher
Test::Warn        version 0.08  or higher

Furthermore, the underlying cairo and pango C libraries are required
at least in version 1.8.8 and version 1.22.4, respectively. These
dependencies are not automatically fulfilled by installing a
sufficiently high version of the respective Perl module. For pango,
the functionality of version 1.22 is indeed required. In contrast,
cairo version 1.2 might actually be enough. However, 1.8 was the
smallest version I got pango compiled with.

With respect to the module code, the dependency on Cairo and Pango
is not strict. Both are loaded by SVG::Rasterize::Engine::PangoCairo
and that module is only loaded dynamically if no other rasterization
backend has been specified (see documentation for details). However,
if you do not provide a different backend, which would probably at
least require a wrapper written by you, then you cannot do anything
without SVG::Rasterize::Engine::PangoCairo (and thereby Cairo and
Pango). Therefore I have included them as a strict dependency. You
could take them out of the Makefile.PL if you know what you are
doing. However, the distribution will not pass the test suite
without them.
