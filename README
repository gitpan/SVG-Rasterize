SVG-Rasterize

Rasterize SVG content to pixel graphics (or whatever you can do with
a matrix of pixels).

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

DEPENDENCIES

SVG::Rasterize depends on the following modules:

Class::Accessor,  version 0.30  or higher
SVG,              version 2.37  or higher
Cairo,            version 1.061 or higher
Params::Validate, version 0.91  or higher
Test::More,       version 0.86  or higher
Test::Exception   version 0.27  or higher
Scalar::Util,     version 1.19  or higher

With respect to the actual code, the dependency on Cairo is not strict.  The
code only requires Cairo in case no other rasterization engine is specified
(see documentation for details). However, if you do not provide a different
backend, which would probably at least require a wrapper written by you, then
you cannot do anything without Cairo. Therefore I have included it as a strict
dependency. Feel free take that out of the Makefile.PL if you know what you
are doing.
